## CSS
I might want to move to the regular Bootstrap css and move away from the themed (bootstrap-marketing) css. I'm currently relying on __pill buttons__, which don't seem to be included in the regular Bootstrap distribution.

## Shortcodes
I need at least the following shortcodes to communicate between Rivescript and my app.

- __^buttons()__ Set and reset context specific buttons
- __^card()__ Send a card to the chat history
- __^image()__ Send an image to the chat history
- __^video()__ Send a video to the chat history
